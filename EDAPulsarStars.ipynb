    "## Introduction\n",
    "A \"pulsar\" is a rare type of neutron star that emits electromagnetic radiation which is perceptible from Earth.  However, like any radiation from space, this is accompanied by a large degree of cosmic background radiation which can make it difficult to percieve where and when pulsars occur.  The following data set documents a variety of stars which met conditions to be pulsars, as well as labels for these stars which indicate whether they truly were pulsars.  Pulsars offer the ability to document a variety of large-scale cosmic phenomena like gravitational waves or the curvature of spacetime.  Thus, being able to correctly identify where pulsars exist is an important question to astronomers."

    "\n",
    "#### The Integrated Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The *integrated profile*, or more formally the *integrated pulse profile*, can be thought of as a pulsar's cosmic fingerprint [[2](http://ipta.phys.wvu.edu/files/student-week-2017/IPTA2017_KuoLiu_pulsartiming.pdf)].  A pulsar generates periodic pulsation signals as it rotates, but each individual signal is often too weak to detect and can vary greatly in shape.  Instead, we integrate over a large number of instantaneous pulse periods to gain an overall profile of what the emissions from the pulsar look like over a substantial periood of time [[3](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/PulsarTiming.html)].  This allows us to determine an average pulse, which is relatively stable with changes in time.  These profiles can be simple or complex, and allow us to identify pulsars by only their radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DM-SNR Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Dispersion Measure-Signal to Noise Ratio Curve*, or *DM-SNR Curve* for short, is another way of classifying a pulsar.  When the pulsar emits electromagnetic radiation, the dispersion by free electrons in the interstellar medium (a bunch of plasma, made up of ionized electrons and other small particles) causes a frequency dependent delay in the radiation as it propagates through the interstellar medium. This causes pulsar emissions to become temporally distorted, by an amount proportional to a quantity called the Dispersion Measure.  This is roughly the density of free electrons between our observatory and the pulsar, in a straight line.  Importantly, for a pulsar, minimizing this Dispersion Measure also corresponds to increasing the Signal to Noise ratio of the received radiation."

The mean and standard deviation are exactly what you would expect; they're the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the observed values.  The kurtosis and skewness may be less familiar; these are what are known as *shape* summary statistics.  Both of these variables describe the shape of a probability distrobution for the given instance; a high kurtosis indicates the presence of many outliers, and a large skewness indicates a longer tail on one side of the distrobution.\n",

One method of determining this is to look at the summary statistics within the set of instances that *are* pulsars versus the summary statistics of those that *are not* pulsars.  For a good discriminator, the expectation would be observably different mean values with low standard deviations; in other words, the distrobutions of each should have little overlap.\n",

    "We'll assume these distrobutions are approximately Gaussian to simplify calculations.  To find the best discriminator, we wish to see how far apart the distrobutions for each of the different attributes are.  We can find this by taking the mean and shifting along the distrobution by one standard deviation.  We now take our dummy points at each of these and find the directed distance between them by subtracting whatever the larger mean's shifted point is from the smaller mean's shifted point.  If the number is positive, the points are still on the proper sides and the distrobutions do not overlap at that distance.  If the number is negative, the distrobutions have overlapped by an amount proportional to the value."

However, this is not surprising; classifying interstellar objects is a difficult task, and the methods attempted here were relatively unsophisticated.  Problems like this one, which have clear structure but are difficult to model, help provide motivation for the ongoing research in machine learning."
